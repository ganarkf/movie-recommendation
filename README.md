# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Web App

A simple responsive movie recommendation web app built with React (Vite) and FastAPI. This app supports both light and dark mode based on the user's browser preferences. This app features a full-stack implementation with a FastAPI backend deployed using **Google Cloud Run**. Fun fact, I developed this just in **2 days**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
